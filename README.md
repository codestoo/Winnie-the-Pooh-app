# Overview

In this solo project I wanted a fun, colorful app of several pages about Winnie the Pooh and the characters of the story and to find qotes in an API was even better than I had hoped for.

## The Challenge

I wanted a page that had all the characters with their individual characteristics, an API to return random quotes, it had to look great and I had just three days. 

## Solutions

I used the map function to loop through the character page that had been set up with their characteristics in a json file. I found an API for the random quotes and used a combination of bootstrap cards and d-flex for the images.

## Technologies

React, Bootstrap, RESTful API

## Style

As an artist and photographer, one of the things I use for composition is the rule of thirds. Titles are centered but most things are off center â€” it all comes down to arranging abstract shapes on the page. I used d-flex to make the images varying sizes since using bootstrap cards doesn't have that fexibility. I used cards for the character page as that did allow me to put in thier characteristics and the variety from page to page of shapes is important.

I used a site, Coolors, for the background color and color of the button on the quotes. If you upload an image, you can get a range of colors.
