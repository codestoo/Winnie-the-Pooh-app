      <h1> More About the Author and what Inspired Him to Write</h1>
      <p>
        A.A. Milne is most famous for his two Pooh books about a boy named
        Christopher Robin, after his son, Christopher Robin Milne (1920–1996)
        and various characters inspired by his son's stuffed animals, most
        notably the bear named Winnie-the-Pooh. Christopher Robin Milne's
        stuffed bear, originally named Edward, was renamed Winnie after a
        Canadian black bear named Winnie (after Winnipeg), which was used as a
        military mascot in World War I and left to London Zoo during the war.
        "The Pooh" comes from a swan the young Milne named "Pooh". E. H. Shepard
        illustrated the original Pooh books, using his own son's teddy Growler
        ("a magnificent bear") as the model. The rest of Christopher Robin
        Milne's toys, Piglet, Eeyore, Kanga, Roo and Tigger, were incorporated
        into A. A. Milne's stories and two more characters – Rabbit and Owl –
        were created by Milne's imagination. The fictional Hundred Acre Wood of
        the Pooh stories derives from Five Hundred Acre Wood in Ashdown Forest
        in East Sussex, South East England, where the Pooh stories were set.
        Milne lived on the northern edge of the forest at Cotchford Farm and
        took his son walking there. E. H. Shepard drew on the landscapes of
        Ashdown Forest as inspiration for many of the illustrations he provided
        for the Pooh books. The adult Christopher Robin commented: "Pooh's
        Forest and Ashdown Forest are identical.
